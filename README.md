# NASA
The "NASA" app is a dynamic MERN stack application which leverages the SpaceX API to gather and present data about launches aimed at discovering new habitable planets. Built with MongoDB for flexible data storage, Express.js to manage server-side operations, and Node.js for server runtime environment, it efficiently processes and serves data to the frontend.

The client-side, built with React.js and enhanced with Arwes, provides a futuristic, user-friendly interface that brings the excitement of space exploration to users in a visually stunning and interactive way.

To facilitate development and deployment, the main package.json includes a series of commands for installing dependencies, running, building, testing, and deploying both the server and client parts of the application. Using the command "npm run deploy", you can run the application which builds the client and starts the server, setting up the full stack application for use.

In addition, the application is Docker-ready, with a Dockerfile included in the project. This allows for consistent and reproducible builds, further simplifying the deployment process, and ensuring that the application can run on any system with Docker installed. This level of automation and standardization makes the application more maintainable and scalable.
