# NASA
The "NASA" app is a dynamic MERN stack application which leverages the SpaceX API to gather and present data about launches aimed at discovering new habitable planets. Built with MongoDB for flexible data storage, Express.js to manage server-side operations, and Node.js for server runtime environment, it efficiently processes and serves data to the frontend.

The client-side, built with React.js and enhanced with Arwes, provides a futuristic, user-friendly interface that brings the excitement of space exploration to users in a visually stunning and interactive way.

To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, the main package.json contains a set of commands for installing dependencies, running, building, testing, and deploying both the server and client portions of the application. To run the application, the command "npm run deploy" can be used, which builds the client and starts the server, effectively setting up the full stack application for use. This thoughtful incorporation of npm scripts aids in maintaining the project, allowing for an efficient deployment and a simplified developer experience.
