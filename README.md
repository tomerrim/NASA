The "NASA" app is a dynamic MERN stack application which leverages the SpaceX API to gather and present data about launches aimed at discovering new habitable planets. Built with MongoDB for flexible data storage, Express.js to manage server-side operations, and Node.js for server runtime environment, it efficiently processes and serves data to the frontend. The client-side, built with React.js and enhanced with Arwes, provides a futuristic, user-friendly interface that brings the excitement of space exploration to users in a visually stunning and interactive way.
